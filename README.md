Viking Tea is a demo storefront for a viking-themed teashop, with a functional shopping cart (though not checkout, naturally), React router, backed by a suite of tests to ensure stability. It's also got a really rad boat animation, with tea treasure boxes that float to the boat and explode in a firework whenever user adds items to the shopping cart.

Viking Tea is active at (https://viking-tea.pages.dev/)

### Features:

- Single-page application w/ react routing for browser back/forward/etc functionality
- Boat animation w/ a treasure pile reflecting number of items in shopping cart, treasure items that float toward the boat when items are added into cart, and a firework animation when floating item reaches boat
- Suite of tests ensure stability in face of additional changes
- Cookies to save shopping cart status even in the face of a reload (not yet implemented)
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop (not fully implemented yet)
